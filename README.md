# 📝 Note Application

A simple note-taking app that lets you add, edit, and remove notes. Notes are stored in the browser's local storage, so they stay saved even when you close the page.

## Features

- Add new notes
- Edit notes in real-time
- Double-click to delete notes with confirmation
- Notes saved in local storage for persistence 🔄

## Credits

This project was inspired by [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6T3PjdX3Os&list=PLXVXNAh1FzAnJf17K1l6dr3K5ggoZLl6e&index=51). The JavaScript implementation has been customized and enhanced for a slightly different approach.

## Usage

1. Click the `+` button to add a new note.
2. Type in the note field to update content automatically.
3. Double-click on a note to delete it (with confirmation).

Enjoy taking notes! ✨
